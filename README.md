## Project: Pole Balancing with Reinforcement Learning ü§ñ

**Description:** This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) solution to balance a pole attached to a cart. Using OpenAI Gym's environment, the goal is to keep the pole upright by applying control actions to the cart.

**Algorithms:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used for training the agent, implemented with stable-baselines3 library in Python with PyTorch as the backend.

**Libraries Used:** The project utilizes gym for the environment, stable_baselines3 for RL implementation, and PyTorch for deep learning computations.

**Installation:** You can install the required modules using `pip install gym stable_baselines3`.

## Future Development üõ†Ô∏è

- Experiment with different RL algorithms and hyperparameters to enhance performance.
- Explore more complex environments and tasks to push the agent's capabilities.
- Extend the project to real-world applications, such as robotics or control systems.
